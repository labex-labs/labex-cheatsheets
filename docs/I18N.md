# Multi-language Documentation Organization Guide

## Directory Structure

Multi-language documentation is organized using a **language-based directory** structure as follows:

```
docs/
  cheatsheets/
    basics.md                    # English (default language)
    built-in-functions.md
    ...
    zh/                          # Chinese directory
      basics.md                  # Chinese version
      built-in-functions.md
      ...
    es/                          # Spanish directory
      basics.md
      ...
    fr/                          # French directory
    de/                          # German directory
    ja/                          # Japanese directory
    ru/                          # Russian directory
    ko/                          # Korean directory
    pt/                          # Portuguese directory
```

## Route Mapping

Documents are automatically mapped to the following routes:

- **English (default)**: `/cheatsheets/basics`
- **Chinese**: `/zh/cheatsheets/basics`
- **Spanish**: `/es/cheatsheets/basics`
- **French**: `/fr/cheatsheets/basics`
- **German**: `/de/cheatsheets/basics`
- **Japanese**: `/ja/cheatsheets/basics`
- **Russian**: `/ru/cheatsheets/basics`
- **Korean**: `/ko/cheatsheets/basics`
- **Portuguese**: `/pt/cheatsheets/basics`

## Adding New Language Documentation

1. Create a language subdirectory under the corresponding documentation directory (if it doesn't exist)

   ```bash
   mkdir -p docs/cheatsheets/zh
   ```

2. Create the corresponding translation file with the same filename as the English version

   ```bash
   # English version: docs/cheatsheets/basics.md
   # Chinese version: docs/cheatsheets/zh/basics.md
   ```

3. Files will be automatically recognized and generate corresponding routes

## Important Notes

1. **Filenames must match**: Multi-language version filenames must match the English version, only the directory differs
2. **English version is required**: The English version serves as the default language and must exist in the root directory
3. **Optional translations**: If a language version doesn't exist, accessing the corresponding route will display a 404
4. **File structure**: Markdown file frontmatter and structure can differ, but it's recommended to keep them consistent for easier maintenance

## Example

Suppose you have the following files:

```
docs/cheatsheets/basics.md          → /cheatsheets/basics
docs/cheatsheets/zh/basics.md       → /zh/cheatsheets/basics
docs/cheatsheets/es/basics.md       → /es/cheatsheets/basics
```

When accessing `/zh/cheatsheets/basics`, it will automatically load the `docs/cheatsheets/zh/basics.md` file.

## Supported Languages

The following languages are currently supported:

- `en` - English (default, no prefix)
- `zh` - Chinese
- `es` - Spanish
- `fr` - French
- `de` - German
- `ja` - Japanese
- `ru` - Russian
- `ko` - Korean
- `pt` - Portuguese

To add a new language, modify the `locales` array in `vite.config.ts`.
